# AI Call Operator

Single-user internal browser tool for outbound calling across multiple offerings. Create a campaign from an offering brief; AI generates its strategy and researches each prospect to prepare the call. Google Sheets is the CRM. The operator clicks Call; Twilio Voice SDK places the PSTN call; Deepgram transcribes both sides; live coaching is an append-only thread with a composer; after hang-up the operator reviews a proposed Sheet update. Calendar invites are drafted in-thread and sent only after Approve.

This is not a CRM, not a multi-agent dialer, not an auto-dialer, and not a compliance product. See **Non-goals** below.

## Non-goals

The application does **not**:

- Auto-dial, power-dial, or parallel-dial
- Send email, SMS, LinkedIn, or **unattended** calendar invites (the model cannot auto-send)
- Train or fine-tune models
- Replace Google Sheets or Gumloop
- Provide a multi-user dashboard, analytics suite, or public SaaS UI
- Guarantee recording-consent or TCPA/GDPR legal compliance
- Write transcripts or coaching text into the Sheet
- Write Gumloop-owned columns

## Architecture

```
Browser (React)  --session cookie-->  Fastify (Node 22)
       |                                    |
       | Twilio Voice SDK                   | TwiML + status + recording webhooks
       |                                    | Media Streams WS -> Deepgram (caller + contact)
       v                                    | Live coach LLM (structured JSON)
   PSTN via Twilio                          | SQLite (campaigns, briefs, sessions, proposals)
                                            v
                                     Google Sheets (CRM)
                                     Gumloop owns source/enrichment columns
                                     This app owns call-outcome columns only
```

Production is **one process**: `npm start` serves the API, webhooks, WebSockets, and the Vite-built client from `dist/client`.

## Local prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm
- A Chromium-based desktop browser for live calling (Playwright E2E uses a fake Twilio device and does not need a microphone)
- For live PSTN: Twilio account, Deepgram key, LLM endpoint, Google service account, a public `APP_BASE_URL` (tunnel), and a Sheet shared with the service account

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values locally. Never commit `.env` or service-account JSON.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
```

Sign in with **email and password** stored in SQLite (`/login` and `/signup`). Successful login sets a signed HTTP-only `SameSite=Lax` session cookie. There is no Google login and no Supabase. Google Calendar OAuth in Settings is only for invites, not for signing into Mantis. Accounts on one box share the same operator workspace (campaigns, Sheet, Calendar). Keep the host private or behind nginx — signup is open to anyone who can reach the app. Set `SESSION_SECRET` to at least 16 characters.

## Multiple offerings and AI campaigns

Use **New campaign** for each product, service, audience, or sales objective. Enter the offering, target customers, desired outcome, and factual product claims the caller may use. AI generates the campaign name, positioning, discovery questions, qualification criteria, likely objections, and next step. **Edit offering** saves a new version and regenerates the strategy. Example YAML campaigns are not loaded into the running app.

Every eligible row in the connected Sheet is in the queue for the selected campaign. Skipping a lead is scoped to that campaign. Sheet eligibility and do-not-contact status still apply globally.

Selecting a prospect automatically prepares a brief for that offering: company and professional prospect research with clickable citations, possible pains to validate, unknowns, a tailored opening, discovery questions with their purpose, possible objections, and a next step. The approach follows flexible discovery principles—understand the situation, problem, impact and desired value before pitching—rather than a memorized script. See [Huthwaite’s SPIN methodology](https://www.huthwaiteinternational.com/spin-methodology).

Campaigns and briefs persist in SQLite. Briefs are cached for 24 hours per campaign version and prospect context. **Refresh research & brief** requests fresh preparation. Changing the offering or prospect context invalidates the old brief for new calls. Each call captures the exact campaign and preparation shown before dialing; live coaching and post-call review keep using that snapshot even after a campaign is edited.

AI campaign calls require a successfully generated, current brief. Missing credentials or invalid model output produce a retryable error, never an example strategy. Research failures are labeled **CRM context only** and cannot create sourced findings. Research, proposed questions and hypotheses are not accepted as evidence that the contact qualified or agreed to a next step.

## Twilio (TwiML app + number)

1. Create an API key; set `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_API_KEY_SID`, `TWILIO_API_KEY_SECRET`, and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`.
2. Create a TwiML Application whose Voice Request URL is `https://<APP_BASE_URL>/twilio/voice/outbound` (HTTP POST). Set `TWILIO_TWIML_APP_SID`.
3. Buy or use a number as `TWILIO_CALLER_ID` (E.164). Point the number’s voice webhook at the same TwiML app if you use it for outbound caller ID.
4. Status callbacks used by the app: `/twilio/voice/status`, `/twilio/voice/number-status`, `/twilio/recording/status`. All HTTP webhooks require a valid `X-Twilio-Signature`.
5. Restrict destinations with `TWILIO_ALLOWED_COUNTRIES` (comma-separated ISO country codes, default `US`).

The browser obtains a short-lived Voice access token from `POST /api/twilio/token` and calls `device.connect({ sessionId })`. The server, not the client, chooses the destination number from the Sheet row.

## Deepgram

Set `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`. Optional: `DEEPGRAM_MODEL` (default `nova-3`), `DEEPGRAM_LANGUAGE` (default `en`).

Twilio Media Streams send both tracks to `WS /twilio/media` with a short-lived `streamToken`. Default mapping until live smoke confirms it:

- `TWILIO_TRACK_CALLER=inbound` → caller
- `TWILIO_TRACK_CONTACT=outbound` → contact

If labels are reversed on a real call, swap those two env values and document the proven mapping in `VERIFICATION.md`.

Without a Deepgram key, the call continues and the UI shows transcription interrupted.

## Google service account and Sheet share

1. Create a Google Cloud service account with Sheets API enabled.
2. Share the spreadsheet with the service account email (Editor).
3. Base64-encode the JSON key file and set `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_BASE64`.
4. Set `SHEETS_BACKEND=google` and `SHEETS_CONFIG_PATH` to your mapping YAML (start from `config/sheets.example.yaml`, copy to `config/sheets.yaml` locally; do not commit real spreadsheet IDs if you treat them as sensitive).

`SHEETS_BACKEND=memory` uses an in-process fixture for local UI and tests. `none` leaves Sheets unconfigured (Call disabled).

## Google Calendar (operator OAuth)

Invites must come from **your** calendar, not the Sheet service account.

1. In Google Cloud, create an OAuth client (Web application).
2. Add authorized redirect URI `{APP_BASE_URL}/api/google/calendar/callback` (for local Vite: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/google/calendar/callback`).
3. Set `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`. Keep `SESSION_SECRET` set — refresh tokens are encrypted with it at rest.
4. Open **Settings** (gear in the navbar) and connect Google Calendar. Consent is `calendar.events` only.
5. On a live call or in review, Approve a drafted event card. Meetings call `events.insert` with `sendUpdates: all` (optional Meet). Callbacks and reminders stay on **your** calendar only (`sendUpdates: none`, no prospect email). Dismiss drops the draft. Nothing is sent until Approve.

Redirect URI the app uses: `{APP_BASE_URL}/api/google/calendar/callback`. For local `npm start` that is `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/google/calendar/callback`. Add the production HTTPS callback too before connecting on Azure.

Playwright and unit tests use a fake Calendar client. Do not rely on live Google for CI.

## Sheet config mapping

`config/sheets.yaml` (or the path in `SHEETS_CONFIG_PATH`) maps **header names**, never column letters:

- `identity_column` / `read_columns.lead_id` — stable Lead ID
- Read: name, phone, company, role, enrichment, campaign, CRM status
- Write: call status/attempts/timestamps, outcome, qualification, objections, next step, summary, Twilio/recording SIDs
- `eligible_when` — which status values enter the queue
- `ownership.gumloop_owned` vs `ownership.application_owned` — disjoint; the app refuses writes to Gumloop columns

Startup preflight requires every configured header to exist exactly once. Invalid schema is a **blocking** error: Call is hidden until the Sheet is fixed. The adapter never writes during preflight.

## LLM

Set `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, and `LLM_MODEL` for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. `LLM_API_MODE` selects `chat_completions` (default) or `responses`. Campaign creation, prospect preparation, live coaching and post-call extraction use validated JSON. Campaign/preparation errors leave saved results unchanged and offer a retry. Invalid live cues are dropped; an active call continues. AI campaigns need this connection to generate a brief; explicitly configured legacy YAML campaigns can still call without coaching.

For a dedicated local LiteLLM proxy using your OpenAI API key, install Docker with Compose and set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the private `.env`. This is the upstream OpenAI key, not `LLM_API_KEY` / `SALES_LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`, which authenticate the app to the local proxy. No ChatGPT subscription login or refresh token is used.

```sh
npm run proxy:setup
npm run proxy:check
npm start
```

On the production server, use `AI_ENV_FILE=/opt/sales-engine/shared/.env npm run proxy:setup` and `AI_ENV_FILE=/opt/sales-engine/shared/.env npm run proxy:check`. Setup preserves the local proxy master key and configures app/research routing. Restart the app if its environment changed. To update only the proxy with production credentials, run `docker compose --env-file /opt/sales-engine/shared/.env -f infra/litellm/compose.yaml up -d --wait`. Never print the resolved Compose configuration, because it includes secrets.

The proxy uses pinned LiteLLM `v1.89.5`. Both `sales-fast` and `sales-research` route to `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` through Responses using `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This uses OpenAI API access and billing. The proxy listens only on `127.0.0.1:4001` and restarts automatically with Docker. The old ChatGPT auth volume is no longer mounted; it does not need to be deleted to migrate. `proxy:login` only prints the migration instructions and cannot start an OAuth login.

Run `npm run proxy:check` to verify actual upstream generation. Container health and `/models` only prove the proxy process/routing is available, not that the upstream key can generate responses. The app logs safe failure categories and reports the last observed AI generation health. Temporary network/429/502/503/504 failures retry at most twice within the original deadline; authentication failures do not retry. Production deployment checks generation before switching releases.

When `LLM_BASE_URL` points to `api.openai.com`, web research reuses that key and model through the [Responses API web search tool](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-web-search). Search is required and source URLs come from provider citation metadata, not URLs invented in generated text. The model must support web search. To use a separate Responses-compatible endpoint, configure `RESEARCH_BASE_URL`, `RESEARCH_API_KEY`, and `RESEARCH_MODEL`; credentials are not implicitly forwarded to a different provider.

`AI_GENERATION_TIMEOUT_MS` defaults to 90 seconds and `RESEARCH_TIMEOUT_MS` to 60 seconds. Live coaching retains its separate `LLM_TIMEOUT_MS` budget. A provider 401 requires checking both the local proxy key and the upstream OpenAI API key. `/health/ready` reports the last observed generation result, including authentication failures; `proxy:check` performs a fresh generation probe.

## AI agents (eve)

The AI capabilities are eve-framework agents under `agents/` — one directory per agent with `agent.ts`, `instructions.md`, and optional `skills/` packs (eve: skills are scoped to the agent that declares them):

- `live-coach` — one compiled `live-cold-call-coach` selected in `skills.json`; live cues also load `config/playbooks/cold-calling.yaml`
- `post-call` — `mantis-post-call-evidence`: grounded transcript extraction
- `campaign-generation` — `mantis-campaign-strategy`: combined targeting, story and qualification method
- `campaign-interview` — `mantis-campaign-intake`: offering inputs and readiness
- `prospect-research` — one compiled `prospect-research-playbook` selected in `skills.json`
- `call-review` — `mantis-call-review`: proposal edits, approval and action state

Do not paste book chapters into prompts. The loader advertises each selected pack’s description and preloads `cheatsheet.md` only. All six deployed agents must select one compiled pack in `skills.json`; application startup validates them before opening the database. Original author packs remain inactive references. The lower-level loader retains directory discovery for legacy callers, but the six-role application requires explicit selection. Missing or empty selected procedures fail visibly. Live coach turns stay scannable (prefer one sentence, cap 400 characters). `src/server/agents/loader.ts` renders the system prompt; the existing OpenAI-compatible transport executes single structured turns. The full eve runtime (durable sessions, AI Gateway) is intentionally not used. Edit `instructions.md` for identity; edit a cheatsheet for procedure. Changes to the rendered research prompt/schema invalidate old prospect briefs while raw web evidence retains its own cache. Contracts live in the zod schemas referenced by `agent.ts`.

See the [sales resource guide](docs/sales-playbooks/resource-guide.md) for the two five-book curricula, verified articles/video transcripts and actual source coverage. All seven unique core books have now been supplied and their relevant methods folded into the compiled skills. Source notes distinguish full-text extraction, targeted reading and public material.

Run `npm run skills:check` for an offline deployment check. `tests/integration/skill-invocation.test.ts` verifies that each real service path sends its selected procedure to the LLM boundary. To run synthetic scenarios against the configured model, use `npm run skills:eval -- --live docs/sales-playbooks/book-foldin-cases.json .firecrawl/skill-evaluation.json`; this uses model credits and requires behavioral review of the saved output. It does not call prospects or perform CRM/calendar actions.

The [agent inventory](agents/README.md) lists all six role skills. The [Mantis integration plan](docs/sales-playbooks/mantis-integration.md) records the upstream comparison, completed source integration and files that must accompany any future publication.

See [skill readiness](docs/sales-playbooks/skill-readiness.md) for the final software checks, recorded model failures and reruns, local model settings, and remaining call-rehearsal requirements.

## Tunnel / `APP_BASE_URL`

Twilio must reach your host. For local live calls:

1. Start the app (`npm run build && npm start`, or `npm run dev` plus a tunnel to the Fastify port).
2. Point `APP_BASE_URL` at the **public HTTPS origin** Twilio uses (no trailing slash issues: the app strips a trailing slash).
3. Signature verification uses `APP_BASE_URL` + webhook path. If signatures fail, the public URL does not match what Twilio POSTs.

Production `npm start` listens on `PORT` (default 3000) and serves the SPA. `npm run dev` runs Vite on 5173 (proxies `/api`, `/health`, `/twilio`) and Fastify on 3000; set `APP_BASE_URL` to the public URL that reaches Fastify for webhooks, not the Vite origin.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Local UI + API (Vite + `tsx watch`) |
| `npm test` | Vitest unit/integration tests (fakes only; no paid APIs, no browser) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Isolated `dist/e2e-client` build + Playwright against faked Twilio/Deepgram/LLM/research/Sheets |
| `npm run build` | Vite production client into `dist/client` |
| `npm start` | `NODE_ENV=production` Fastify serving API + `dist/client` |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `./scripts/deploy-production.sh` | Azure VM only: fetch `origin/main`, build, switch `/opt/sales-engine/current`, restart `sales-engine` |

Migrations in `migrations/` run automatically on process start. SQLite defaults to `DATABASE_PATH=./data/ledger.sqlite` (WAL mode).

First Playwright run on a machine:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

## Production deploy (Azure VM)

Pushes to `main` run `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. GitHub Actions SSHs into the VM, resets `/opt/sales-engine/control` to `origin/main`, builds a timestamped release under `/opt/sales-engine/releases/`, points `/opt/sales-engine/current` at it, restarts `sales-engine`, and checks `/health/live` plus `/health/ready`. It does **not** restart `sales-engine-tunnel`. Secrets stay in `/opt/sales-engine/shared/.env`; SQLite and `sheets.yaml` stay in `/opt/sales-engine/shared/data`. Production binds `HOST=127.0.0.1` so nginx (basic auth + Twilio `/twilio/` and Calendar OAuth `/api/google/calendar/callback` bypass) is the public entry. Unit file and nginx templates live in `infra/`; deploys do not rewrite `/etc`.

One-time VM setup (SSH in as `azureuser`). Safer if the VM checkout is still behind GitHub or has local commits:

```bash
cd /opt/sales-engine/control
git fetch origin main
git checkout origin/main -- scripts/install-github-actions-ssh.sh
# Run as azureuser (not root); the script sudoes only for sudoers.
bash scripts/install-github-actions-ssh.sh
```

Then add GitHub Actions secrets (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`):

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_HOST` | VM public IP or DNS |
| `AZURE_USER` | `azureuser` |
| `AZURE_SSH_KEY` | Private key from `~/.ssh/github_actions_sales_engine` **on the VM** |

From a laptop that can SSH to the VM:

```bash
gh secret set AZURE_HOST --body "YOUR_VM_PUBLIC_IP"
gh secret set AZURE_USER --body "azureuser"
ssh azureuser@YOUR_VM_PUBLIC_IP 'cat ~/.ssh/github_actions_sales_engine' | gh secret set AZURE_SSH_KEY
```

The VM clone must `git fetch origin main` without a prompt (HTTPS credential or a read-only GitHub deploy key). Local commits that are not on GitHub are discarded on deploy (`git reset --hard origin/main`). Untracked files such as `config/sheets.yaml` are kept.

Allow inbound SSH (port 22) from GitHub Actions. After secrets are set, use **Actions → Deploy Sales Engine → Run workflow**, or push to `main`.

A Cloudflare quick tunnel URL can change if `sales-engine-tunnel` restarts; prefer a named tunnel or a stable domain for Twilio `APP_BASE_URL`.

## Docker

One image, one process. Persist SQLite on a volume. `--env-file .env` can override `DATABASE_PATH`; set it to the volume path so data survives restarts.

```bash
docker build -t sales-engine .
docker run --env-file .env -e DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/ledger.sqlite -p 3000:3000 -v sales-engine-data:/app/data sales-engine
```

## SQLite backup and recovery

The ledger holds campaigns, assignments, research briefs, sessions, utterances, coaching events, and review proposals. It is not a CRM backup of Google Sheets. Include it in backups to preserve offering setup and historical call context.

**Backup** (app can be running; WAL checkpoint is safest with the app stopped):

```bash
sqlite3 ./data/ledger.sqlite "PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE);"
cp ./data/ledger.sqlite ./data/ledger-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sqlite
```

**Restore:** stop the process, replace `ledger.sqlite` (and remove stale `-wal`/`-shm` if you restore a consistent copy), restart. After restore, compare Sheet rows before approving any `pending_retry` proposal.

Default Docker volume path is `/app/data/ledger.sqlite`.

## Troubleshooting

**Microphone.** Live Twilio calling needs a real mic and browser permission. Playwright E2E does not. If device.register succeeds but you hear nothing, check OS input device and that another app does not hold exclusive access.

**Twilio device offline/error.** The browser retries connection failures with backoff (2–30 seconds), retries failed token refreshes, and reconnects after connectivity returns. Token fetches time out after 10 seconds; registration attempts time out after 20 seconds. Tokens last one hour and refresh before expiry. Recovery does not destroy a device carrying a call. Settings shows the last SDK error, and the server logs structured browser status/error codes without tokens. A valid server token response alone does not prove browser registration succeeded.

**Twilio URL audit.** Run `TWILIO_ENV_FILE=/opt/sales-engine/shared/.env node scripts/check-twilio.mjs` to verify account credentials, caller number, public health and the TwiML application's voice/status URLs. After confirming the intended deployment, add `--sync` to update those URLs and methods. Production deployment runs the read-only audit before switching releases. Keep session creation and webhooks on the same application/database. Use a stable public hostname; temporary tunnel URLs can change on restart.

**Webhook signature 403.** `APP_BASE_URL` must be exactly the origin Twilio uses (scheme + host + port). A tunnel that rewrites HTTP/HTTPS or a trailing-slash mismatch will fail `X-Twilio-Signature`.

**Speaker mapping.** Defaults are inbound → caller, outbound → contact. If the live transcript swaps sides, flip `TWILIO_TRACK_CALLER` / `TWILIO_TRACK_CONTACT` and record the proven mapping in `VERIFICATION.md`. Do not assume the default is correct on PSTN.

**Deepgram connection.** Missing key or a dropped stream shows **Transcription interrupted**. Mute and Hang Up stay available. The proposal marks the transcript incomplete. Check `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` and that Media Streams can reach `/twilio/media`.

**Sheet schema.** Missing or duplicate headers block Call with an actionable error. Fix the Sheet header row to match `config/sheets.yaml`; do not invent column letters in code. Refresh after fixing.

## Privacy and recording

Recording and transcription may be active. The UI shows `RECORDING_NOTICE`. Give any required notice before substantive conversation. This application **does not** determine legality of recording in your jurisdiction and **does not** store credentialed Twilio media URLs—only Recording SIDs. Transcripts stay in SQLite, not in Sheets. Do not commit call recordings, transcripts, or real lead PII.

---

## Operator runbook

### 1. Before a calling session

- `/health/live` returns ok; `/health/ready` shows Sheet schema valid, campaigns loaded, and Twilio configured.
- Ready page: campaign selected, next lead dialable, Twilio device **registered**, Sheet status not `error` / `unconfigured`.
- Confirm `APP_BASE_URL` and the TwiML app still match the running host.
- Confirm you are not in a drain/restart (new Call would 503).

### 2. Pending Sheet write

If Approve fails, the proposal stays **pending_retry** with the error. Use **Retry write** on the review screen. Do not re-run extraction unless you intend to. The ledger records one application-level batch; a successful retry applies once and read-back verifies cells. If the lead’s phone or Lead ID changed on the row, you will get `identity_conflict`—fix the Sheet identity, do not guess another row.

### 3. Transcription degradation

If the UI shows **Transcription interrupted**, keep talking or hang up; do not assume missing evidence. Cues hide while health is interrupted. After the call, the proposal should show an incomplete transcript and lower-confidence / incomplete outcomes. Fix Deepgram/network before the next session.

### 4. Do not contact

If the contact asks not to be called, the coach shows a warning to acknowledge and end. On review, DNC is visually prominent. Approving writes a suppression status (`Do Not Contact`). That lead must not return to the eligible queue. Do not Skip as a substitute for DNC if they asked to be suppressed.

### 5. Campaign changes

Use **New campaign** or **Edit offering** in the app. Review the generated strategy and the prospect brief before calling. A confirmed negative qualification criterion uses its generated `onNo` behavior (disqualify, defer, or continue discovery); qualification does not depend on fixed criterion names. Do-not-contact always overrides campaign rules.

For existing installations, explicitly authored YAML files under `CAMPAIGNS_DIR` remain supported. Files named `*.example.yaml` or `*.example.yml` are excluded from startup. Custom YAML is loaded on restart; its criteria can specify `negative_outcome: disqualified`, `defer`, or `unknown`. Research/networking campaigns must not declare sales-close outcomes such as `meeting_booked`. Tests explicitly inject example campaigns as fixtures.

### 6. Ownership disjointness

Gumloop-owned headers (IDs, name, phone, enrichment, CRM status, etc.) must not appear in `application_owned`. The write path allowlists application columns only. If Gumloop edits enrichment mid-call, Approve still must leave those cells untouched. If you add a Sheet column, assign it to exactly one owner in YAML and re-run preflight.

## Verification

See [`VERIFICATION.md`](./VERIFICATION.md) for the acceptance matrix, holdouts H1–H14, and the live PSTN smoke checklist (live smoke is credential-gated and is not implied by `npm test`).
